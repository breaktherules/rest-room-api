Hotel Reservation
========================
This Application is created as a small demonstration of coding and design skills.  The requirements are deliberately kept simple for a casual reader.

  
Requirements :
 Create a simple room reservation system for a small hotel. The hotel has N rooms all of same size, so there is no distinction for Single or  Double Bedroom. 
 People call receptionist to :
 
 1. Reserve a room , given the guest name and reservation dates. If a guest wants to reserve two rooms. receptionist will have to make two separate reservations.
 2. Find if there is an availability during a period of From and to dates.
 3. Cancel a reservation.
 4. Given a Guest name, find if he has a reservation.


 
Some Constraints
================
1. A reservation is only for one room, if a guest wants more than one rooms booked, he needs to make individual reservation for each room.

2. Only receptionist uses the system , so we will not worry about security requirement, login, etc.

3. No Specific Database required.

4. Fully unit tested.

5. Separation of concern.

6. Use php web server and sql-lite so that the system can be run on even the minimalist of environment.
